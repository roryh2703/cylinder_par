# the code sed -n 'p;N;N' chooses which line of pressure correction to plot. The number of 'N' determines how many the ploting ignores. If 3 GAMG pressure solvers are employed, then 'p;N;N' will plot the FIRST GAMG, ignore the next two.

# -f9 determines which field to plot, counted after 'GAMG:', for example: "solving for p". e.g. GAMG: Solving for p, Initial residual = 0.193462, Final residual = 1.37372e-05, No Iterations 8. In this example the 9th field is 1.37372e-05.
